                    It is an example project build to showcase proficiency with Flask, 
                    several other associated modules/libraries as well as web
                    development essentials like html and css. The name was inspired by mythology, 
                    and comes from the Roman goddess of memory.

                    I have no aspirations to turn this into a full-size client-facing application
                    as of now but I may always change my mind later. It has been very rewarding
                    and enjoyable working on this and I mean to improve upon this in the future.

                <p class="help-text">
                    Moneta enables users to read borrowed e-books online free of cost. We aim to
                    have a wide selection of books, genres and authors so as to provide a little
                    something to everyone. Carefully curated by the volunteer librarians; magic,
                    romance, thrills and mystery await the reader!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Users are limited to 5 borrowed books at the moment. Note that delay between
                    return time and time for borrowing another book may vary, as this is managed 
                    semi-manually. If a week is not sufficient time for the user, they can always
                    request the book again.
